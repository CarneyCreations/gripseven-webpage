# [GripSeven Store](https://carneycreations.github.io/gripseven-webpage/)

## For a laugh
During this project I tried to rekindle a spark and develop my CSS knowledge. If you haven't read the readme from my [first webpage](https://carneycreations.github.io/personal_webpage/) I recommend checking it out. Web1 at it's finest! 
This time around I used the Bootstrap framework which I did find useful, but more for showing me what was possible. 

## Description
With this project I had to create an online store which had products for sale. My friend has his own company GripSeven and I thought I could use his LaceBrace product to base the website around. Here I used responsive web design for the first time and it really helped to control boundaries of items. If you viewed the readme above you'll understand! 

Working with forms and cards for the first time made the building of the website a lot more enjoyable. On my last project I struggled with filling the space and trying to make it look more interesting. These broke up the page and gave a much more attractive view.The way I wanted the page layout was for the products to take up a lot of the screen and to run verically. I achieved this however, having finished it I do now think I could have reduced the card sizes by 10-15% to make it look more professional. Alas, I haven't found a way yet of doing this which effects all of the contents of the cards.My favourite part was making the images reactive and finally tying together this webpage, allowing for apreciation of the new things I had learnt.
